# An approach to the efficient constraint validation and reduction of Simulation Cost of Large Scale Complex River System.

Author: "Arpan Biswas"

# Research Objective:

Renewable energy, such as hydroenergy, is one of the major sources for electricity generation for energy sectors. Over many decades, there has been continuous development of water resource management for the economic benefit of electricity industries. However, in real world, these energy sectors deal with different sources of uncertainties like Inflows, Market Prices and Market Demand of electricity which significantly impacts their operations and therefore in generating revenue. Therefore, we generate a Robust Optimization framework for maximizing the Net Revenue and thereby provide a robust solution of optimal operation control. However, RO model is too expensive due to it's high simulation and function evaluation costs during qunatification and propagation of uncertainity through the large scale complex system. This can make the model inefficient since the operators need to run the model at regular interval of time (hourly). Also, we can not risk the accuracy of estimation of the quantities of interests for efficient constraint validations. This is necessary to ensure the model does not provide any solutions which can be detrimental to the environment. Therfore, in this project, our primary research objective is to find out an efficient way to quantify and propagate uncertainity through complex River system. Efficiency is measured here in terms of reducing the simulation time along with better estimation of the parameters (mean, variance) of quantities of interest for constraint validations like Storage, Forebay Elevation, Turbine Flow, Power Output, Forebay elevation End of Period constraints.
