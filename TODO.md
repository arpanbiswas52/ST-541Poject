To Create a Milestone for project

$Week 5: Due 10/25/2018$

Research study on the optimization algorithm in R of the project and answer the following questions:

Can we use any nonlinear constraint algorithm to build the optimization model?

If not, can we use some other technique/workaround to show the optimization results of the project?

If not, need to review the scope of the project and find some other ways to answer the primary research objectives proposed in the project.

Update: 

We could find some Non-linear constraints algorithm package in R suitable for our project. We will use package "nloptr" for solving non-linear constrained optimization problem. 
Specifically we will use Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm "slsqp" which solve nonlinearly constrained, gradient-based optimization, supporting both equality and inequality constraints. This classical method is known to be one of the powerful optimization algorithm due to fast convergence and therefore is the best approach in this project as one of our primary research objective is reducing the computational effort. 

$Week 6: Due 11/01/2018$

Based on what we decide on week 5, start coding. 

Create the data file with all the data required. 

Create all the required folders in the project to store appropiate function .rmd files. 

$Week 7: Due 11/08/2018$

To start the integral part of coding. Writing several functions as required.

$Week 8: Due 11/15/2018$

Continue coding. 

Complete the simulation part. 

Start the coding for optimization by writing objective functions and constraints(Can confirm this part after completing Week 5 milestone). 

$Week 9: Due 11/22/2018$

Complete the optimization part. (Can confirm this part after completing Week 5 milestone). 

Start report writing with the results found. 

$Week 10: Due 11/29/2018$

Complete Report and Presentation slides for project presentation
